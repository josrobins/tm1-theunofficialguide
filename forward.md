This project started with one day reading a post by [Christoph Hein](https://github.com/scrumthing) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophhein_tm1-leantm1-planninganalytics-activity-6816020978133450752-O10a) where the community of TM1 enthusiasts were discussing TM1 Congnos: The Official Guide, mainly when, if ever, this book would beupdated for the significant changes to TM1 since it was published. 

It got me thinking, if there was no such interest from the publisher, would there be interest from the community to create an open-source, community written resource which would fill the gap? A project that would cover the basics, and the advanced topics needed to use, administer and develop with the TM1 application enviornment, including the eco-system of interfaces and third-party tools which are present today, and into the future?  

Well I'm about to fund out
